## QA Automation Playground (Playwright Experiments by a QA Engineer)

Hello!!   
This is my personal repository, where I use **Playwright + TypeScript** to apply and improve my automation knowledge as a Software QA Engineer.

This repo serves as my *automation playground* — a collection of automated test scripts written for various *free/public demo websites*

## The GOAL  is simple: continuously learn.
